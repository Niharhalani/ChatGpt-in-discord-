            Discord-Search-Engine is a discord bot that can help students by answering their questions in the server <br >
            Since ChatGpt requires email and phone number authentication so it can be a hurdle for most of the students who doesn't have a phone number to use it and that's where our bot will help you to get the answers quickly without opening your browser even once (so that you're not distracted)

## Inspiration
The main purpose of buiding this project is to deploy our knowledge of programming endeavours to create something unique and innovative. 
ChatGpt in discord is an intuitive use of AI to make user interface on discord server more responsive and interactive.
The important aspect of creating this project is to contribute to the community by our work for educational purposes.

## What it does
The chatGpt in discord is a live AI chatbot that can answer any questions, and works as a search engine on a given discord server. 
The user can access the chatBot using a link and choosing their discord server. To elaborate, to get into the chatbot,
the user needs to give the command /chat. The chatbot will start working in discord server and the user can enjoy using it.

## How we built it
The chatGpt in discord project has been built in the python programming language with revChatGpt package. 
It has be implemented using some various modules such as msg, discord and json. The chatGpt doesn't 
hold the official API yet. Thus, an unofficial API is used to built the project.

## Challenges we ran into
A great challenge to face while creating this project is that, a good amount of research was required to search 
for the API of chatGpt as it only comprises an unofficial API and not an official API. 
Most of us from the team were participating for the first time in a hackathon, so with tight deadlines it was quite difficult to led this research.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The remarkable rewards of implementing this project is to utilize latest technology and getting acquainted with AI. 

## What we learned
The essential takeaway from this hackathon experience is working on close deadlines, teamwork and patience. 

## What's next for ChatGpt in discord
We have decided on improvising this model of chatGPT in discord, by adding some notable features like private chat,
that would provide user the privacy and comfort to ask questions in a more confidential manner.
